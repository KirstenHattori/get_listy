//App.js returns:
  -Header.js
  -Footer.js
  -GetListy.js

//GetListy.js 
  -import firebase config info module
  functions as a props bridge between Form.js and MetaList.js by:
    containing state init and passing it to Form as a prop to be updated by form submit
  +holds firebase side effect (useEffect) and uses onValue to listen for changes to db. on state change: (re)render MetaList which triggers (re)renders of Lists and ListItems
  

//Form.js
  -bind the form internal state to GetListy's state so that react can micromanage and have controlled components
  -prevent form from submitting if there is user error ie. empty inputs. display error message to reflect issue

//MetaList.js
  -map through the metaList piece of state and generate an li for each List title and pass them the array of listItems as props

//List.js
  -render a title for the List and ListItem components based on the props recieved from metaList

//ListItem.js
  -receive an item in the array of listItems from List as props and render an li element
  -render a button to delete item from the list - interacts with firebase(onValue)
